Facade Pattern
can take a complex subsystem and make it easier to use by implementing facade class that provides one, more reasonable interface.
Prevents from creating designs that have a large number of classes coupled together.
The Facade Pattern provides a unifi ed interface to a
set of interfaces in a subsytem. Facade defi nes a higher-
level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
